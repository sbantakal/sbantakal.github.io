                    <p>My initial exploration into the fascinating world of machine learning involved delving into the intricacies of supervised and unsupervised learning in artificial neural networks. I was eager to gain a deeper understanding of these concepts and decided to put my knowledge to the test by training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) on the MNIST handwriting data. The insights and observations I gathered from this experience were truly eye-opening and served as a foundation for my further studies in this field. Through this hands-on project, I learned the importance of correctly supervising the training process in order to achieve accurate results and the power of unsupervised learning in uncovering hidden patterns and structures in data.

                    <h2>P2P File Transfer <a href="https://github.com/sbantakal/bittorrent-simulator" class="icon brands fa-github"><span class="label"></span></a></h2>
                    <p>As a passionate software developer, I was intrigued by the inner workings of file transfer protocols and the mechanisms that enable efficient and fast data transfer over the internet. This led me to embark on an exciting project to build a file transfer simulator, drawing inspiration from the popular Bit Torrent application. The simulator was developed using Java programming language and leveraged its powerful socket programming and multithreading capabilities to implement various crucial operations.

                        The project involved implementing complex algorithms to break down a large file into smaller chunks, and then transferring these chunks simultaneously over multiple connections, resulting in a significant increase in the transfer speed. This approach is similar to the one used by Bit Torrent, and I was thrilled to see how my implementation performed in real-world scenarios. The project was a great learning experience and provided me with a deep understanding of the intricacies of file transfer protocols and the power of multithreading in improving performance.</p>

                    <p>As part of our quest to gain a deeper understanding of distributed communications, we embarked on an exciting project to build a web application using the Elixir Phoenix Framework. Our goal was to create a realistic simulation of a social media platform, and we achieved this by implementing key features such as user account creation with randomly generated usernames, subscriber assignment to each user based on Zipf distribution, and core functions such as tweeting, re-tweeting, following, and unfollowing.

                        The project was a great opportunity for us to apply our knowledge of Elixir and the Phoenix Framework, and we were thrilled with the results. The application was highly scalable and able to handle a large number of concurrent users, making it a true testament to the power of the framework. We were proud to showcase our work in a demo on YouTube, which can be accessed at the link provided - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSeAbfgqRWs" class="icon brands fa-youtube"></a>. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience and allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of distributed communications and the critical role that web applications play in connecting people and information.

                    <h2>Crime Data Visulaization Tool</h2>
                    <p>The aim of our project was to develop a cutting-edge real-time web application that could process vast amounts of criminal records and present insights and key trends in a visually engaging manner. To achieve this, we sourced a dataset of criminal records made publicly available by the Chicago Police Department.

                        Our team leveraged the power of the Python Django Framework to build a robust and scalable web application that could handle millions of records. To bring the data to life, we utilized the Chart.js library to create insightful graphs and heatmaps that effectively visualized the patterns and trends present in the criminal records.
                        
                        The result was a powerful tool that provided a comprehensive view of criminal activity in the area, enabling law enforcement agencies, researchers, and the general public to better understand the nature and extent of criminal activity. Our project demonstrated the importance of using technology to process, analyze and present data in a meaningful and accessible manner, and it was a great opportunity for us to showcase our skills in web development and data visualization.</p>
